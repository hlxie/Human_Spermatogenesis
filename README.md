## Introduction 


Research on epigenetic regulation of human spermatogenesis remains limited, particularly in understanding the epigenetic dysregulation associated with abnormal spermatogenesis. In this study, we employed high-quality scATAC-seq to investigate the epigenetic regulatory states of male germ cells during both normal spermatogenesis and its disruption in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients. We identified key transcription factors (TFs) and their target gene networks, demonstrating that their synchronized and wave-like activities are critical for driving the highly ordered progression of spermatogenesis. Additionally, we uncovered significant epigenetic changes at DNA double-strand break (DSB) hotspots, tracing their formation and repair processes at the single-cell level. We showed that a male germ cell set up open chromatin state for several thousands of DSB hotspots. Of these, several hundreds go on to forms DSBs and finally several dozens of these DSBs forms crossovers, permitting proper exchange of genetic materials between parental alleles through homologous recombination. In NOA patients, spermatogenesis is arrested at the zygotene stage with many master TFs showing aberrant dephasing and decoupling. These regulatory failures hinder the spermatogenesis from progressing to the next developmental stage properly. Additionally, we identified point mutations as genetic basis for the dysregulation of TF motif activation such as for NFYB-PITX2-HMGA1 axis. Abnormal DSB hotspot dynamics were also revealed in NOAÂ patients, with approximately half of the opened DSB hotspots in each cell lost accessibility compared to normal spermatogenesis, contributing to a 2-3 fold increase in aneuploid sperm cells. Our findings provide a deeper view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying human spermatogenesis and offers new perspectives on the pathogenesis of NOA.
